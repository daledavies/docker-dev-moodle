# Docker LAMP Environment for Moodle Development

Docker development environment with Apache, PHP and MySQL, also sets up xdebug and data directory for Moodle. Exposes web server on port 80 and databse on 3306. Includes Visual Studio Code configurations for xdebug and SQLTools extension. 

Nothing fancy, I just use this for local Moodle development.

To use just build with Docker Compose and put Moodle in the html directry.
